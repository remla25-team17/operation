### Grafana

We have implemented everything up to and including the sufficient requirements and also the excellent requirement.
From the good requirements, we have implemented the following:

- The dashboard employs variable timeframe selectors to parameterize the queries.
- The dashboard applies functions (like rate or avg ) to enhance the plots.
  From the good requirements, we have not implemented the following:
- The dashboard contains specific visualizations for Gauges and Counters

### Continuous Experimentation

We have implemented everything up to the sufficient requirement 'The system implements the metric that allows exploring the concreteÂ hypothesis.' The requirements missing are:

**Sufficient**

- The documentation describes the experiment. It explains the implemented changes, the expected effect that gets experimented on, and the relevant metric that is tailored to the experiment.
- The experiment involves two deployed versions of at least one container image.
- Both component versions are reachable through the deployed experiment.

**Good**

- Prometheus picks up the metric.
- Grafana has a dashboard to visualize the differences and support the decision process.
- The documentation contains a screenshot of the visualization.

**Excellent**

- The documentation explains the decision process for accepting or rejecting the experiment in details,
  ie.g., which criteria is used and how the available dashboard supports the decision.
